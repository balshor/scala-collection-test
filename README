This project contains Specs tests for the Scala Collection library.  It was
inspired by conversations with Alex Boisvert (@boia01) and started at a Bizo
(www.bizo.com) open-source hackday.

Currently, only part of the Traversable/TraversableLike traits are covered.  The
eventual goal is to have composable specs mirroring the Scala collections 
hierarchy that can be used to verify the behavior of new implementations, as
well as refactorings of existing collections as the library evolves.
